# EcomVoice – Your AI Eye for Online Shopping 🛒👁

Making e-commerce fully accessible for people with vision difficulties and the elderly.

EcomVoice is a web tool designed for e-commerce owners to bring the power of sight to users who cannot see clearly. By integrating a simple button on product pages, it acts like a personal AI guide, describing products in detail colors, sizes, prices, textures, and more—while users can ask questions in real-time, just as if someone were sitting next to them explaining everything visually.
